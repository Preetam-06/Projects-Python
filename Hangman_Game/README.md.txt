This project is a Python-based graphical Hangman game focused on geography. It challenges the user to guess the name of a country based on a short descriptive hint. 
The game is built using Tkinter for the user interface and a custom dataset of countries with clues.


## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Place `hangman_main.py` and `hangman_words.py` in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:


## Overview

Hangman Globe is designed as a simple yet educational application. 
It selects a country at random from a predefined dictionary and provides the user with a hint. 
The player must guess the country name one letter at a time. 
With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is displayed. 
The game ends when the user either completes the word or runs out of guesses.

## Features

- Over 190 countries with brief hints to guide the player
- Visual hangman progress display
- Clean and interactive graphical user interface using Tkinter
- Option to play again after the game ends
- Basic input validation and feedback messages


This will launch the game window. You can begin typing letter guesses based on the provided hint.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
- Use of dictionaries for structured data
- Random selection from key-value pairs
- Event-driven programming in Tkinter
- Game logic handling and user feedback
- Modular Python design by separating data and interface
